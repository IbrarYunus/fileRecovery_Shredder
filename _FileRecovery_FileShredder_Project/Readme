*****************************************
|| File Recovery/File Shredder Project
|| Ibrar Yunus
||
|||||As part of OS course project
|||||Uses some code given by instructor
*****************************************
Current State:
	works on only ext2 disk images
	compiles to runScan
	takes 2 arguments ~ location of disk image and location of output directory
	parses disk image and retrieves JPEG images (deleted and not deleted) and saves them to the output folder

Future Plans:
	The work is divided as follows:

 		Create automated unit tests to test the software for future testing code change
 		Heavily test current software to clear out any ambiguities
 		Optimize the current code and run tests

 		Extend functionality to other common file types ( major image formats, document formats, video formats etc)	
 		Fork a new version to implement file shredding functionality ( i.e. shredding at inode block level )

 		Modify File Shredder to shred a specific file based on inode number or file name
 		Optimize Code and run tests

 		Modify File Recoverer to recover specific file based on inode number or file name or from specific directory
 		OPtimize Code and run tests	


*Note:
	As of now the code is partially commented, will comment it fully in 2-3 days.
